# Todo List App

## Project Description

This is a simple `Todo List App` project written in `Vanilla JS`. The application includes basic functionalities such as **adding, deleting, marking as done, editing** and **saving**, along with **local storage**. I created this project for learning purposes in my free time. In the near future, I plan to make some improvements and expand it with new functionalities.

## Important Information
