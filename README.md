# Todo List App

## Project Description

This is a simple `Todo List App` project written in `Vanilla JS`. The application includes basic functionalities such as **adding, deleting, marking as done, editing**, and **saving**, along with **local storage support**. I created this project for learning purposes in my free time. In the future, I plan to make improvements and possibly expand it with new functionalities.
